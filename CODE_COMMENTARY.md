### Imports
1-6. **Import Libraries:** 
   - `cv2`: This is OpenCV, a library for computer vision tasks.
   - `numpy` as `np`: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
   - `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
   - `urllib.request`: Used for opening and reading URLs.
   - `logging`: Used for logging messages.
   - `imageio`: A library for reading and writing image data.

### Set up Logging
8. **Configure Logging:** Sets the logging level to INFO. This means the logger will handle only INFO and higher level (like ERROR) messages.

### Function Definitions
10-21. **Function `load_and_process_image(url)`:** 
   - This function takes a URL, downloads the image, and processes it.
   - `try...except`: This is a try-except block for error handling.
   - Inside the block, the image is downloaded, converted to a NumPy array, and then decoded into an image using OpenCV.
   - `cv2.Canny()`: Applies the Canny edge detector to find edges in the image.
   - If an error occurs during this process, it's caught and logged, and `None` is returned.

23-30. **Function `perform_fft_transformation(coords, n_components, total_length)`:**
   - Performs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and its inverse on the given coordinates.
   - `fft_result`: Stores the FFT of the coordinates.
   - `fft_reconstruct`: Initializes an array of zeros with the same shape as `fft_result`.
   - The function then fills parts of `fft_reconstruct` with values from `fft_result` based on `n_components`.
   - Finally, it performs an inverse FFT and returns the reconstructed coordinates.

32-36. **Function `plot_reconstructed_image(ax, image, title)`:**
   - Plots an image on a given axis (`ax`) with a title.
   - `ax.imshow()`: Displays the image.
   - `ax.set_title()`: Sets the title of the plot.

38-57. **Function `generate_gif_images(n_steps, fft_length, coords, dimensions)`:**
   - Generates images for each step in the FFT process to be used in a GIF.
   - `gif_images`: A list to store each generated image.
   - The loop runs `n_steps` times, each time performing FFT transformation and generating an image which is added to `gif_images`.
   - `filter_valid_coords`: Ensures that only valid pixel coordinates are used when reconstructing the image.
   - Each image is created as a blank image with `np.zeros` and filled with the reconstructed edge points.

59-63. **Function `filter_valid_coords(x, y, shape)`:**
   - Filters and returns only the valid coordinates that fit within the given shape (dimensions of the image).

### Main Function
65-96. **Function `main()`:**
   - The main function where the program execution starts.
   - Loads an image from a URL and applies edge detection.
   - Sets up a figure for plotting.
   - Finds edge coordinates and performs FFT transformations.
   - The loop generates images for the GIF and plots them at specified intervals.
   - `plt.tight_layout()`: Adjusts the layout.
   - `plt.show()`: Displays the plot.
   - Finally, `imageio.mimsave` creates a GIF from the generated images.

98-99. **Script Execution Check:**
   - This is a Python idiom. `__name__ == "__main__"` is True if the script is run as a standalone file (not imported as a module).
   - If true, the `main()` function is called.
