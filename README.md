# Line Drawings with FFT and Python

## Overview

This repository contains code for illustrating decomposing line drawings using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Python. The project leverages OpenCV for edge detection and NumPy for FFT decomposition and reconstruction.

## Features

- Edge Detection using OpenCV's Canny algorithm
- FFT Decomposition and Reconstruction using NumPy
- Visualisation using Matplotlib

## Detailed Explanations

For a detailed explanation of each step, including the logic behind FFT and the image processing techniques used, check out the Jupyter Notebook hosted on Google Colab: [Detailed Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J0PDOwg7EVWOZkXc7qUab7fnZijvnO7i?usp=sharing).
